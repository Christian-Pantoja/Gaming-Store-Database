# Gaming-Store-Database
Developed a program user interface for a gaming store that utilizes an SQL Database to store all the data, such as all the information of the customer, employee, product, store, and much more. In conjunction, the program is comprised of a gaming store, gaming studio, and a manufacturing facility that can all log on to the UI to perform their specific tasks and those tasks call upon queries to execute a change in the database. The customer can sign up/log in to the store and select all the products they desire to purchase. As soon as there is a new user, transaction, or update in the inventory, the database automatically updates its respective tables (result data). During this project I learned how to integrate a database into a python UI, and update sed database once a query is called upon from an action performed in the UI. The project also has a EER diagram, Flow Diagram, and relational mapping that can be seen in the GitHub.
