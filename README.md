# Gaming-Store-Database
Developed a program user interface for a gaming store that utilizes an SQL Database to store the vast amount of data. In conjunction, the program is comprised of a gaming store, gaming studio, and a manufacturing facility that employees or customers can log in to perform their specific tasks and those tasks call upon queries to either update, insert, or delete data into the database. As soon as there is a new user, transaction, or update in the inventory, the database automatically updates its respective tables (result data). To remain organized, I designed an EER diagram, Flow Diagram, and relational mapping to show its complex infrastructure that can be viewed in the projects GitHub repository.
